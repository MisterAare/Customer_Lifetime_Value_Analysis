# Customer Lifetime Value Analysis with Python


# Introduction

For this project, I delve into the essence of customer lifetime value. My analysis delves deep, comparing the cost of acquiring customers with the revenue they bring. Furthermore, I explored the effectiveness of diverse marketing channels and campaigns in attracting high-value customers.

# Importing Essential Python Libraries and Datasets

In this section, I imported vital Python libraries and the dataset that will serve as the bedrock of my Customer Lifetime Value Analysis. This initial groundwork is crucial as it sets the stage for the insightful exploration that lies ahead.

# Data Exploration

In order to comprehend the dataset I’m handling, I engage in data exploration. This involves identifying patterns, comprehending interrelationships among columns, and detecting potential outliers. This preliminary analysis helps unveil insights and provides a foundational understanding of the data’s structure.

# Data Analysis and Visualization

In this section I use the Python library (Matplotlib) to visualize the data to generate insight by:

1. Visualize the distribution of acquisition costs and revenue generated by the customer using histograms.
2. Compared the cost of acquisition across different channels and identified the most and least profitable channels.

# Calculating the Customer's Lifetime Value

Based on the data that I have, I calculated the Customer Life Time Value (CLTV) using;

CLTV = (revenue — cost) * conversion_rate / cost

# Summary
Customer lifetime value analysis serves the purpose of approximating the overall value that customers bring to a business throughout the entirety of their engagement. This analytical tool aids companies in making informed decisions regarding investments in customer acquisition and retention strategies. Additionally, it aids in pinpointing the most valuable customers, enabling focused retention endeavours.
